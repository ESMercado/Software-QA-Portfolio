## Software QA Portfolio

**About Me**

Hi, my name is Elmer or **"Mer"** for short. Since the biginning of 2024 I have gained a lot of interest in the area of QA Testing in the software developement lifecycle. As someone who have been supporting businesses and corporations by building systems to efficiently handle company data to readable information for the last 5 years, I begged the question "How do I check if what I'm creating now properly works in production?".

With this portfolio, I would like to share the things I have learned and applied from the courses I have joined, the self-taught journey I have gone through and parts of my past work experience as an independent developer. I am determined and excited to grow in this field of IT
